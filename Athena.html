  <p style="color:grey">We are a group of 19 girls from Evergreen Valley High School's
    Robotics Club
    committed to building, coding, and eating Oreos! As a rookie team
    participating in this year's FTC RES-Q mission, we are facing
    new challenges and experiences as expected. <br>

    So what is RES-Q? FIRST asked FTC around the world to design a robot
    that will be able to do some of the following: <br>
    - Pick up debris to place in the floor or mountain goals <br>
    - Trigger a color beacon based on alliance color <br>
    - Climb up a mountain and hang <br>
